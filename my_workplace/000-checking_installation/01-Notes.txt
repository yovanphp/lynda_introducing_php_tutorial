1. When we run the phpinfo() function, we get 
 - the version of the PHP used - 5.5.12
 - The location of the loaded configuration file, php.ini : C:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.4.9\bin\php.ini
 - core/display_errors: On - by default in WAMP.
 - core/error_reporting: must be 32767
 - date/Default timezone: Europe/Paris

 Note: 
 - display_errors must be turned off in production environment, for security purposes.
 - The default timezone must be set properly do that the correct time is used.

All these settings can be changed within the php.ini file.

2. If we can't edit the php.ini file directly (for example the service provider hosting our app does not gives us access), we can still define a .htaccess file in the server's document root folder. This will only work if the server is running apache.
Configuration directives that set a value are preceded by php_value.
Directives that turn a setting on or off are preceded by php_flag

For example:
# Apache does not know E_ALL constant so we use 32767
php_value error_reporting 32767
php_flag display_errors on
php_value date.timezone America/Los_Angeles

Some servers use .user.ini file instead of .htaccess
For example:
; The configuration directives use the same syntax as php.ini
error_reporting E_ALL
display_errors = on
date.timezone = America/Los_Angeles

If neither of these alternatives are available to us and if we simply want to change settings on the fly at runtime temporarily for a specific script: 
<?php
ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', '1');
date_default_timezone_set('America/Los_Angeles');

E_ALL is a constant but 1 is a string, hence the latter is in quotes.
